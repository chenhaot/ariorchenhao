      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>Every week, Ari and Chenhao each submit 3 hot takes. Your job is to guess who said what!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read each hot take casually</li>
        <li>Click "Ari" or "Chenhao" to make your guess</li>
        <li>See how much each hot take resonates with you</li>
        <li>Come back each week for new hot takes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>What's a Hot Take?</h2>
      <p>A hot take is a bold, sometimes controversial opinion. It's meant to provoke thought and
      discussion. We focus on AI hot takes, maybe also academia and life. It is mostly for fun!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>The Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each week features 6 hot takes (3 from each person)</li>
        <li>Hot takes are shuffled randomly</li>
        <li>No hints, just pure intuition</li>
        <li>To make this game fair, we promise that we believe each hot take, at least to some extent. We are not making up opinions for the sake of the game.</li>
      </ul>
